Voice Assistant Project
Introduction

This is a voice assistant project that aims to provide a conversational interface for various tasks using voice commands. The voice assistant utilizes speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech conversion to enable users to interact with their devices using spoken commands.

Features

    Speech Recognition: The voice assistant can listen to the user's voice commands and convert them into text using speech recognition technology.
    Natural Language Processing: It employs natural language processing techniques to understand the user's intent and extract relevant information from the spoken commands.
    Text-to-Speech Conversion: The voice assistant can generate synthesized speech to respond to the user's queries or provide requested information.
    Command Execution: It executes specific commands or performs actions based on the user's requests, such as opening applications, searching the web, retrieving information, setting reminders, etc.
    Customization: Users can customize the voice assistant by adding or modifying commands to suit their specific needs.



    Usage

Once the voice assistant is running, you can interact with it using voice commands. Start by saying the wake word or a designated phrase to activate the assistant. After the wake word, you can issue various commands or ask questions. The voice assistant will process your command, execute actions accordingly, and provide a response.

Some example commands you can try:

    "Open Google Chrome."
    "What's the time?"
    "Play some music."
    "Tell me a joke."
    

Feel free to explore the available commands and customize the assistant to suit your needs.
